           ---------With Clause ---

 The WITH clause is used in queries in which a derived table is unsuitable.
 Therefore, it is considered a neater alternative to temp tables.
 Put simply, the key advantage of the WITH clause is that it helps
 organize and simplify long and complex hierarchical queries by 
  breaking them down into smaller.


CTE is a temporary named result set that you can refrence within a
select,insert,update,delete.

select *  from emp;

with cte1 AS (select ename,sal from emp where dept in(10,20,30))
select * max(sal)from cte1;
